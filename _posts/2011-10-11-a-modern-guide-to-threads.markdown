[Mike Perham](http://www.mikeperham.com) of [Carbon Five](http://www.carbonfive.com) just wrote an excellant post on the [Carbon Five Blog](http://blog.carbonfive.com) called [A Modern Guide to Threads](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/10/11/a-modern-guide-to-threads/) where he explains what a thread is and how to avoid race conditions using Ruby's only synchronization mechanism, the Mutex. Mike advocates using Actors which he uses extensively in his [Girl Friday](https://mperham.github.com/girl_friday) project.

You can find more information about Actors in Mike's 2011 RubyConf presentation: [Actors and Threads - Safer Concurrency for Ruby](http://www.slideshare.net/mperham/actors-and-threads). Video of that presentation will be posted soon.
